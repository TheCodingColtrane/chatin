# Chatin

This is chatin chat application. An app whose main concern is to connect people so they can communicate.

This application was created using golang, gorilla WebSocket and vue.

Bugs are expected, the application is still work in progress. 

To run the application locally you need to build it manually. In the future we will add a docker file or MakeFile to easen that up. 

We hope you like it.
